# 1. Rumble Jungle!
Rumble Jungle! was my biggest project yet. A full application developed for the entire SDLC and live-ops.

# 2. Personal Contributions
I initially pitched the idea of pong in a circular multiplayer arena as it seemed viably scoped as a six-month project from start to release.

# 3. Project Timeline
### Pitch and Demo (Jan 2021 - Jun 2021)
Rumble Jungle! was the first project incubated under Cargo Studio. I gathered a team of 1 artist, 1 designer and 1 fellow programmer to pitch and demonstrate the project. The incubation lasted six months and in that time, we completed a vertical slice of the game. Unfortunately the rest of the team had to leave the project due to other commitments and having to find full-time jobs. The incubation only provided a small stipend.

### Vertical Slice (Jul 2021 - Oct 2021)
I coordinated with two artists in Vietnam whcih Cargo Studio introduced to me to further develop the UI while I polished the game further.

The goal was to have a polished version for Gamescom 2021 where we could shop the game to publishers. I created a trailer for the game in Adobe After Effects and modified the game to display in landscape so as to capture gameplay.

GamesCom was a great success, we succeeded in the goal of getting two publishers interested in publishing the game and were featured in the Straits Times.

### Monetization, Compliance and Scaling Up Servers and Open Beta (Nov 2021 - May 2022)
We were able to find a publisher in AppGuru and we got to work expanding upon the game for full release. In the meantime, the game was released in a limited beta on Google Play to perform A/B testing. 

On the development end, I linked up additional backend and advertising services such as PlayFab and Facebook/Unity Ads. 

Additionally I liasoned with AppGuru's cloud engineer to host the server builds on Huawei Cloud. 

### 1.0 Release and Live Ops (Jun 2022 - Sep 2022)

Additionally, the game was featured several times on Apple's Game of the Day which helped boost visability.

Unfortunately, I was unable to continue the project as I had started my role at Tencent and the workload became too much to juggle both Rumble Jungle! and my job. I left the game with the pubilishers and updates were put on hold indefinitely.
