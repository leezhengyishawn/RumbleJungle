# 1. Rumble Jungle!
Rumble Jungle! was my biggest project yet. A full application developed for the entire SDLC and live-ops.

# 2. Project Overview
### Jan 2021 - Jun 2021
Rumble Jungle! was the first project incubated under Cargo Studio. I gathered a team of 1 artist, 1 designer and 1 fellow programmer to pitch and demonstrate the project. The incubation lasted six months and in that time, we completed a vertical slice of the game. Unfortunately the rest of the team had to leave the project.

### Jul 2021 - Oct 2021
I coordinated with two artists in Vietnam to further develop the UI while I polished the game further.

The goal was to have a polished version for Gamescom 2021 where we could shop the game to publishers. I created a trailer for the game in Adobe After Effects and modified the game to display in landscape so as to capture gameplay.
